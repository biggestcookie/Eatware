p... pogbot is a great name! I swear!

Tag bot, bot guides you through the process - address, what kind of food, radius of food, options you want, present X number of restaurants in the area, can switch out options. Available people can vote on it and bot will send out a reminder. Base of lunch bot, but will include multiple options + lunch.
Usage of Dialogflow for smooth human/bot interaction

Potential addition: Wait time @ restaurants
Mapping out base user inputs and build from there
MVP Criteria /Usage of Dialogflow?:
Slackbot workflow activated through tagging the bot that will parse through user input and take in necessary parameters to match it with Yelp/Google tags on restaurants.
What's your location/how far are you willing to go/dietary restrictions/
suggest N number of restaurants
Display: Is this good, or do you want different options
Then guide person through voting process
What time are you going?
Send reminder at N time

Additional goals:
Potential training and application of GPT-2 model in order to have a smoother/accurate user interaction

Fallback (No GPT) Option:
Web Scraper and some kind of language processor, scrape through user reviews as well to get tags not necessarily covered by Yelp tag, (Ex. Kid friendly, too spicy, bad service) and associate that with questions asked by ppl
